# LA Hacks React Workshop Resources

This repository contains skeleton code for the
live code-along as well as information on how to
set up the project before the workshop begins.

We will be building a simple tic-tac-toe game.

Requirements before beginning the example:

1) Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6 syntax), and Git
   will be very useful and make everything move more smoothly.

2) Install a recent version of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
   Select the version "Recommended For Most Users".

3) Install GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com/). This will
   install both the command line version of Git and the GUI.

4) Clone [this](https://github.com/punteek/la_hacks_react_workshop)
   repository into a new folder.

5) Navigate into the `my-ap` directory, `npm install` then `npm start`
